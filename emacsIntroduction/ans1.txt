  - Esc-M-x what-line for current line

01. man -k "string" (man man)
02. whereis cp whereis wc, cp: /usr/bin/cp wc: /usr/bin/wc (alternatively use: which)

		/usr/share/man/man1p/cp.1p.gz /usr/share/man/man1/cp.1.gz
	- wc: /usr/bin/wc /usr/local/cs/bin/wc 
		/usr/share/man/man1p/wc.1p.gz /usr/share/man/man1/wc.1.gz
03. find /usr/bin  -name "?" [ Syntax: find Directory -name "?" ], "?" to find one-char

	g + s -> Set Group ID
	o-x -> owner remove permission to run executable or search for directory
06. find / -mtime -21 -type f
07. find / -mtime -21 -type d
08. whereis find -> find: /usr/bin/find
	cd /usr/bin/
	find -type l | wc ->  287     287    2901
09. cd /usr/lib
	ls -l -a -t
	-rwxr-xr-x   1 root root  414960 Aug  7 13:43 libfreeblpriv3.so

	LC_*  environment variables
11. emacs C-h a sort
		C-x b *Apropos*

12. - C-Meta-a: takes you to a beginning of a defun
	- C-M-b: moves backwards over an balanced expression ex. Assignment 1 cursor on 1 to A
	- C-M-c: recursive edits in progress are exited
	- C-M-d: move down in parenthesis structure
	- C-M-e: moves to the end of the defun
	- C-M-f: moves forwards over an balanced expression. Assignment 1 cursor on A to 1
	- C-M-g: rehighlight a range of lines
	- C-M-h: highlights the region around the current following defun 
	[Observations done by attempting the key strokes on eMacs]
13. - C-g cancels a command quickly, keyboard-quit
14. - Yank will will paste the last stretch of text that was recently killed (kill ring)
15. -ls -l command: 1 file/dir per row, info: location/date, files listed are view only
