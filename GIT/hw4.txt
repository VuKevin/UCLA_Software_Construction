02. Check out version 3.0 of Diffutils from your repository, 
into a new branch named “quote”.

git checkout v3.0 -b quote 

Output: Switched to a new branch 'quote'


03. Install your change into this new branch, by running the patch
command with your patch quote-3.0-patch.txt as input.
patch -p1 < quote-3.0-patch.txt 

patching file src/cmp.c
patching file src/diff.c
patching file src/diff3.c
patching file src/dir.c
patching file src/sdiff.c
patching file src/util.c

04. Learn how to use the Emacs function add-change-log-entry-other-window 
(C-x 4 a).

C-x 4 a in each file to add entries

05. Use this Emacs function to compose an appropriate ChangeLog entry for 
your patch, by adapting the change log from the original patch.

emacs src/cmp.c  
C-x 4 a
Add the change message
Repeat


06. Commit your changes to the new branch, using the ChangeLog entry as the 
commit message.
git add .
git commit -a -m "ChangeLog"


07. Use the command “git format-patch” to generate a file formatted-patch.txt.
This patch should work without having to fix things by hand afterwards.

git format-patch -1 --stdout  > formatted-patch.txt



08. Your teaching assistant will assign you a partner, who will also generate
a patch. Verify that your partner's patch works, by checking out version 3.0 
again into a new temporary branch partner, applying the patch with the command 
“git am”, and building the resulting system, checking that it works with
“make check”.

git am formatted-patch.txt -> to apply my partner's patch

or

git am --reject --whitespace=fix formatted-patch.txt
	so any failures will result in a rej file

Partner: Henry Zhu
./bootstrap
./configure
make
make check


09. Verify that your ChangeLog entry works, by running the command
“make distdir” and inspecting the resulting diffutils*/ChangeLog file.

make distdir


10. There is a copy of the GNU Emacs git repository's master branch on SEASnet 
in the directory ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs. Run the command gitk on it, and find
the newest merge that is not newer than 2015-01-25. Take a screenshot
gitk-screenshot.png of your view of the mergepoint, and in an ASCII text
file gitk-description.txt briefly describe the roles of subwindows that you
see in the screenshot.

Mac: Install XQuartz
ssh -X hoai@lnxsrv01.seas.ucla.edu 
git clone git://git.savannah.gnu.org/emacs.git   (get emacs source)
cd emacs       (get inside the emacs root folder)
gitk (Show gitk GUI)
