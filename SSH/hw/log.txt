Premise: 
========
	What you'd like to do is to be able to run processes (Firefox...etc) on the other student's hosts.
	- Ex. Log into a neighbor's host, and run a program there that displays on your host
	- To do that: You need to set up an account on your neighbor's host, and vice versa so that you neighbor can log on your host and do the same
		- BUT, you would then need to exchange pw over the Internet... need to avoid t hat.

Exercise in defense:
	- Set up computers so you can log into each other's hosts w/o letting the other teams into your own hosts
	- *Don't actually try to break into the other team's hosts 
	- Use OpenSSH to establish trusted connections among your teams' hosts. 
		- Make logins convenient so use ssh-agent on your host to manage authentication
			- That is, you should be able to log out of your host (all connections dropped) then log back in
				- By typing your passphrase ONCE to ssh-agent
				- Then be able to use ssh to connect to any of your colleagues' hosts w/o pw or passphrases
	- Also use port forwarding so you can run a command on a remote that displays on your host
		EX. Should be able to log into a remote host, type 'xterm' and get a shell window on your host
