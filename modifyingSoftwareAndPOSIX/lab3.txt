WHAT: You're helping build an app that contains a shell script
	- It invokes the ls command to get file status
	- Application runs on Maroon Enterprise Linux 5 distribution
	- ls implementation supplies by Coreutils 7.6

PROBLEM:
	- For some users, ls will generate this output:
		$ ls -l /bin/bash
		-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 729040 2009-03-02 06:22 /bin/bash

	- Instead, users want the traditional Unix format:
		$ ls -l /bin/bash
		-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 729040 Mar  2  2009 /bin/bash

	- The problem is actually b/c some users set their locale incorrectly:
		ex. en_US.UTF-8 | $ export LC_ALL='en_US.UTF-8'
		# Users who do this get YYYY-MM-DD instead of traditional dates

	- The problem is that the locl files for Coreutils is incorrect
		- We patch the ls program instead
	- http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-coreutils/2009-09/msg00410.html

WORKAROUND ATTEMPT (Installing a small change to a big package):
- I installed Coreutils 7.6 using wget
- Extracted the file (Untar + unzip) : $ tar -xzvf coreutils-7.6.tar.gz
- I made the coreutilsInstall directory mkdir ~/coreutilsInstall
- Compile source code:
	- ./configure --prefix=/coreutilsInstall
	- *Note: --prefix flag required or won't work on Linux Server
- make | immediately after
- make install prefix=~/coreutilsInstall | immediately after
	-> Program should be now installed
- To test for the bug:
	- cd to coreutilsInstall/bin
	- I ran ./ls -l (You can't just type 'ls' cause shell looks for /bin/ls)
	- Then I ran ./ls -l /bin/bash
	- Result: -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 960376 2015-07-08 04:11 /bin/bash
		- this shows the date format is the former Y-m-d h:m
- Applying the patch (patches are inherently .diff files):
	- cd /w/home.04/ce/ugrad/hoai/coreutils-7.6
	- vim patchfile
	- patch -p1 < patch_file (man patch)
- 'make' at the top level of my source tree
- ls.c is the original file for reference
- Notable Commands from make: 
- Were the CC ls.o update which was necessary
	- because it directly worked with ls.cpp
- CCLD dir which did not need to be updated.
- CCLD vdir which did not need to be updated
- CCLD ls needed to be executed since ls.o was affected
- Check to make sure patch was successful
	- cd /w/home.04/ce/ugrad/hoai/coreutils-7.6/src
	- ./ls -l
	- And the dates are fixed
- touch newFile
- touch -t 201401210959.30 oldFile
- ./ls -l
	- -rw-r--r-- 1 hoai ceugrad      0 Jan 21 16:49 newFile
	- -rw-r--r-- 1 hoai ceugrad      0 Jan 21  2014 oldFile
- I then traveled into the coreutilsInstall/bin directory via
	- cd ~/coreutilsInstall/bin
	- ./ls -l
	- And this resulted in the incorrect date structure which was intended
